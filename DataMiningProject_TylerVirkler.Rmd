# Background

Cryptocurrency has grown exponentially in value, resulting in it being the frequent topic of conversation and news.  Many know that bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, but what isn't as known is that there are various types of cryptocurrency which offer slightly different capabilities.  For the purpose of this analysis we will focus on solely Bitcoin to keep control of the scope. 

Bitcoin is a virtual currency with the purpose of decentralization and low transaction fees.  This is possible through the utilization of blockchain technology.  "A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions in a given system that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as completed blocks are added to it. The blocks are added to the blockchain in linear, chronological order through cryptography, ensuring they remain beyond the power of manipulators. The blockchain thus stands as a tamper-proof record of all transactions on the network, accessible to all participants. The blockchain offers a chance to work at lower costs with greater regulatory compliance, reduced risk, and enhanced efficiency." (Bajpai) As more and more blocks are added to the chain the system becomes more secure.

It is common for people to say they are "investing" in Bitcoin, but what essentially that person is doing is betting on the increased adoption of Bitcoin.  Why is this true?  Bitcoin has no physical value.  The USD for example is backed by the US Government and as the world's reserve currency.  The value of BTC is merely based on the law of supply and demand. This is interesting because unlike paper currency BTC has a cap on the amount of coins that can be produced, 21 million, which is usually deemed a positive.  This carries significance because governments continue to put more currency into circulation which in turn devalues it over time.  Due to the supply being limited to 21 million, as demand increases the value will likely increase. Hypothetically, let's say the United States were to adopt BTC as its currency.  In 2013 there were approximately 1.2 trillion USD in circulation, M1, plus all the money in accounts less than 100k USD, referred to as M2 (Clark and Whitbourne). Along with that information, there will ultimately be 21 million BTC in circulation.


```{R}

USD=10500000000000 # 10.5 Trillion USD (USA Money in Circulation)
Bitcoin=21000000   # 21 Million Bitcoin (Most Bitcoin that will be in Circulation)
Value=USD/Bitcoin  # Value of Bitcoin compared to current dollar
cat("Value=",Value)
```
The result is approximately 500,000 USD/BTC in circulation.  What is the current going rate for one BTC?  16,000 USD/BTC.  Keep in mind this an overly simplistic view of the situation and not entirely accurate because there are a lot of factors that weigh into the price of bitcoin, not solely these two variables.  Also, the likelihood of the United States adopting BTC as its universal currency is small, but some countries that are susceptible to significant currency manipulation, like hyperinflation, may be enticed to use bitcoin. Or, even individuals may revert to cryptocurrency so that their money holds value.  This is currently occurring in Venezuela, who has announced it will be moving to cryptocurrency.  Venezuela's GDP is approximately 371 billion USD.
```{R}

USD=371000000000 # 371 billion (Venezuela GDP in USD)
Bitcoin=21000000   # 21 Million Bitcoin (Most Bitcoin that will be in Circulation)
Value=USD/Bitcoin  # Value of Bitcoin compared to the current dollar
options("scipen" =10)
cat("Value=",Value)
```
The result is still an increase over the current USD/BTC value of 16000 USD.  As stated above this measure is an overly simplistic view. 


Most detractors of bitcoin use the argument of the cryptocurrency not being tied to anything of value, like the USD once being backed by gold.  The USD is not currently backed by anything of physical value other than the US government, and even that is being tested by the continual introduction of new currency into circulation.  The entire premise of bitcoin relies on adoption as an everyday platform and an increased percentage of transactions being captured.  The below analysis will take a closer look at the driving factors behind the value of bitcoin.

```{r}
cor <- cor(BTCm[,c(2:4,6:25)]) #selecting variables to include in correlation analysis

colnames(cor) <- c("MarketPrice", "TotalBTC", "MarketCap", "BlocksSize","AvgBlockSize","OrphanedBlocks", "Ntransactions","MedConfirmTime","HashRate","BTCDifficulty","MinersRevenue","TransactionFees","CostPerTransaction%","CostPerTransaction","NumUniqueAddresses","NumTransactions","NumTansactionsTotal","TransactionsExPop","TransactionsExLong100","OutputVolume","EstTransactionVolume","EstTransactionVolUSD","Days")

corrplot(cor, method = "square",  tl.srt = 50, tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.6, title = "Correlation of Variables", mar=c(0,0,1,0))

```

The variables closest related to Market Price are Market Cap, Hash Rate, Difficulty, Miner Revenue, and Estimated USD Transaction Volume


##Market Price vs. Market Cap
```{R}
ggplot(BTCm2, aes(BTCm2$btc_market_cap, BTCm2$btc_market_price)) + 
  geom_point(color="firebrick") +
  ggtitle('BTC Market Capitalization vs. Market Price') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=19.5, face="bold", 
    margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)))+
  labs(x="Market Cap (USD)", y="Market Price (USD)")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=50, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",  formula = y ~ x, col = "yellow")

```

##Regression Model Summary
```{R}
lmfit1<-lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price~BTCm2$btc_market_cap)
panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit1, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price ~ Market Capitalization")
R1=summary(lmfit1)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", R1)
```

Market Capitalization is signficant to Market Price.

##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmfit1, pch=16, which=1)
```

There appears to be a pattern in the residuals plot above starting at zero and increasing linearly to approximately 1000 on the x-axis.  This will be taken into account when selecting variables for a regression model.


##Estimated USD Transaction Volume vs. Market Price
```{R}
ggplot(BTCm2, aes(BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd/1000000, BTCm2$btc_market_price)) + 
  geom_point(color="firebrick") +
  ggtitle('BTC Transaction Volume vs. Market Price') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=19.5, face="bold", 
    margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)))+
  labs(x="Transaction Volume MM (USD)", y="Market Price (USD)")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",  formula = y ~ poly(x,2), col = "yellow")

```
##Regression Model Summary
```{R}
lmfit2<-lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price~poly(BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd,2))
panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit2, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price ~ Estimated Transaction Volume (USD) Squared")
R2=summary(lmfit2)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", R2)
```

Transaction volume is significant to Market Price.

##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmfit2, pch=16, which=1)
```

There appears to be heteroscedasticity in the residuals plot, which is not ideal.  This means the residuals variance increases as the prediction values increase.  Also meaning as the price increases the variability increases.  One way to remedy this may be to transform a variable in the model.

##Second Iteration Market Price ~ Estiamted Transaction Volume

Because the model is bottom heavy in both the x and y direction a log transform should help.

##Regression Model Summary
```{R}
lmfit2b<-lm(log(BTCm2$btc_market_price)~log(BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd))

panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit2b, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price ~ Estimated Transaction Volume (USD) Squared")
R22=summary(lmfit2b)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", R22)
```

```{R}
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # init 4 charts in 1 panel
plot(lmfit2b)
```

The log transform improves the heteroscedasticity issue significantly in the x direction, the dispersion on the y-axis is not ideal but less of pattern

##Market Price ~ Miners Revenue 
```{R}
ggplot(BTCm2, aes(BTCm2$btc_miners_revenue/1000000, BTCm2$btc_market_price)) + 
  geom_point(color="firebrick") +
  ggtitle('BTC Miners Revenue vs. Market Price') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=19.5, face="bold", 
    margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)))+
  labs(x="Miners Revenue MM (USD)", y="Market Price (USD)")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",  formula = y ~ poly(x,2), col = "yellow")

```

##Regression Model Summary
```{R}
lmfit3<-lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price~poly(BTCm2$btc_miners_revenue,2))
panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit3, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price ~ Miners Revenue (USD) Squared")
R3=summary(lmfit3)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", R3)
```
##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmfit3, pch=16, which=1)
```

Residuals have clustering, and not the best overall dispersion including heteroscedasticity.


##Difficulty vs. Market Price
```{R}
ggplot(BTCm2, aes(BTCm2$btc_difficulty/1000000000, BTCm2$btc_market_price)) + 
  geom_point(color="firebrick") +
  ggtitle('BTC Difficulty vs. Market Price') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=19.5, face="bold", 
    margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)))+
  labs(x="Block Find Difficulty (Billions)", y="Market Price (USD)")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",  formula = y ~ poly(x,2), col = "yellow")

```
##Regression Model Summary
```{R}
lmfit4<-lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price~poly(BTCm2$btc_difficulty,2))
panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit4, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price ~ Block Find Difficulty Squared")
R4=summary(lmfit4)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", R4)
```
##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmfit4, pch=16, which=1)
```

Interesting patterns formed, not random dispersion.


##Hash Rate vs. Market Price
```{R}
ggplot(BTCm2, aes(BTCm2$btc_hash_rate/1000000, BTCm2$btc_market_price)) + 
  geom_point(color="firebrick") +
  ggtitle('BTC Hash Rate vs. Market Price') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=19.5, face="bold", 
    margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)))+
  labs(x="Hash Rate (Millions)", y="Market Price (USD)")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",  formula = y ~ poly(x,2), col = "yellow")

```
##Regression Model Details
```{R}
lmfit5<-lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price~poly(BTCm2$btc_hash_rate,2))
panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit2b, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price ~ Hash Rate")
R5=summary(lmfit5)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", R5)
```
##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmfit5, pch=16, which=1)
```

Some heteroscedasticity, but relatively flat line. 


#What is the signifigance of these variables to the market price?

##All variables
```{R}
lmBTCm <- lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price~., BTCm2)

panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmBTCm, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price vs. All Variables")
Rb1=summary(lmBTCm)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", Rb1)
```

##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmBTCm, pch=16, which=1)
```

Most of the volume is located in the lesser x-region, but the trend line relatively flat.

##Highly Correlated Variables only
```{R}
lmBTCm2 <- lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price~BTCm2$btc_market_cap+BTCm2$btc_hash_rate+BTCm2$btc_difficulty+BTCm2$btc_miners_revenue+BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd, BTCm2)

panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmBTCm2, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price vs. Highly Correlated Variables")
Rb2=summary(lmBTCm2)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", Rb2)
```

It appears that all of the highly correlated vairables to Market Price (Market Cap, Hash Rate, BTC Difficulty, Miners Revenue, and Estimated Transaction Volume USD) are significant.

##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmBTCm2, pch=16, which=1)
```

Neither even dispersion nor a flat trend line.  Model adjustment needed.

##Narrowing Down Variables for the Model

```{R}
lmBTCm3 <- lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price~BTCm2$btc_difficulty+BTCm2$btc_miners_revenue+BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd, BTCm2)

panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmBTCm3, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price vs. Highly Correlated Variables")
Rb3=summary(lmBTCm3)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", Rb3)

```

##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmBTCm3, pch=16, which=1)
```

Market Capitalization and Estimated Transaction Volume are highly correlated, only one will be included in the model.  Also, because Difficulty and Hash Rate are highly correlated, the model will only include one.

```{R}
lmfit6 <- lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price ~ BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd + BTCm2$btc_miners_revenue)

panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit6, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price vs. Transaction Volume and Miners Revenue")
Rb6=summary(lmfit6)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", Rb6)

```
##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmfit6, pch=16, which=1)
```

Some heteroscedasticity, but the best the model so far.


##3-D Plot of the Regression Plane
```{R}
s3d <- scatterplot3d(BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd, BTCm2$btc_miners_revenue, BTCm2$btc_market_price, 
                     pch=16, highlight.3d = TRUE, type = "h", 
                     main = "Multi-Variable Regression 
                     \nMarket Price ~ Transaction Volume + Miners Revenue", 
                     xlab="Transaction Volume", 
                     ylab="Miners Revenue", 
                     zlab="Value (USD)", 
                     angle=35)
s3d$plane3d(lmfit6)
```

3-dimensional plot based on the variables in the above regression model. The plane is based on the linear model lmfit6.


# Polynomial Multivariable

```{R}
lmfit7 <- lm(BTCm2$btc_market_price ~ poly(BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd, 2) + poly(BTCm2$btc_miners_revenue, degree=2))

panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit7, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price ~ Miners Revenue Squared + Count of Transactions Squared")
R7=summary(lmfit7)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", R7)
```
Improvement in R-Squared value over the non-polynomial multivariable regression.

##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmfit7, pch=16, which=1)
```

With polynomials introduced it results in a flatter line, and the best model so far.  Not as much dispersion as recommended.


#Train Model and Test

##Creating the Training Subset and Test Subset
```{R}
set.seed(1)
train.index<-sample(1:nrow(BTCm2),0.80*nrow(BTCm2), replace=FALSE)
train <- BTCm2[train.index, ]
test  <- BTCm2[-train.index,]
```

##Training and Testing
```{R}
#Using the same model settings as above for lmfit7.

lmtrain <- lm(btc_market_price~poly(btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd,2) + poly(btc_miners_revenue,2) , train)
test$p1 <- predict(lmtrain,test)

ggplot(test, aes(test$Days)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=test$btc_market_price),color="Firebrick") +
  geom_line(aes(y=test$p1), color="Blue")+
  ggtitle('BTC Prediction vs. Actuals') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=16, face="bold", 
    margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)))+
  labs(x="Days", y="Market Price (USD)")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))+
  labs(title = paste("BTC Linear Regression Model Prediction vs. Actuals",
                     "\n\nAdj R2 = ",signif(summary(lmtrain)$adj.r.squared, 5),
                     " P =",signif(summary(lmtrain)$coef[2,4], 2)))
```

Model does a good job tracking the test set.


#Percent Change

```{R, message=F, warning=F }
BTCm<-mutate(BTCm, pChange=(BTCm$btc_market_price-lag(BTCm$btc_market_price))/lag(BTCm$btc_market_price)*100) #Add column for percentage of change

ggplot(BTCm, aes(BTCm$Date, BTCm$pChange)) + 
  geom_point(color="firebrick") +
  ggtitle('BTC Percent Change vs. Time') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=20, face="bold", 
    margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)))+
  labs(x="Date", y="Pct. Change")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=50, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))
```

##Mutate Data in Percent Change
```{R, message=F, warning=F}
library(zoo)

BTCm2$AVGtransactionvolume<-BTCm2$btc_estimated_transaction_volume_usd

BTCm11<- subset(BTCm2, BTCm2$AVGminersrevenue>0)
BTCm11<-mutate(BTCm11, pctChange=(BTCm2$btc_market_price-lag(BTCm2$btc_market_price))/lag(BTCm2$btc_market_price)*100)

  labs(x="Date", y="Pct. Change")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=50, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))



```

##Correlation Analysis of Transformed Variables
```{R}
cor2 <- cor(BTCm11[c(2:2167),c(26:30)]) #selecting variables to include in correlation analysis

colnames(cor2) <- c("% Change Transx Volume", "% Change Miner Rev.","% Change Market Cap", "% Change Market Price","Change Total Coins")
rownames(cor2) <- c("% Change Transx Volume", "% Change Miner Rev.","% Change Market Cap","% Change Market Price", "Change Total Coins")

corrplot(cor2, method = "square",  tl.srt = 50, tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.6, title = "Correlation of Variables", mar=c(0,0,1,0))

```

Percent change in market price is highly correlated with percent change in market capitalization.


#What is the significance of these variables to the percent change in market price?

```{R}
lmfit8 <- lm(pctChange ~ AVGmarketcap+AVGtotalbitcoins, BTCm11)

panderOptions("digits", 2)
pander(lmfit8, caption = "Linear Model: Market Price Change ~ Market Cap Change + Total Coins Change")
R8=summary(lmfit8)$r.squared
cat("R-Squared = ", R8)

```

##Residuals
```{R}
plot(lmfit8, pch=16, which=1)
```

Model is flat with no obvious pattern other than a few outliers causing low dispersion.  Will move forward with this model.


#Train Model and Test Percent Change

##Creating the training subset and test subset
```{R}
set.seed(1)
train2.index<-sample(1:nrow(BTCm11),0.90*nrow(BTCm11), replace=FALSE)
train2 <- BTCm11[train2.index, ]
test2  <- BTCm11[-train2.index,]
```

##Training and testing
```{R}

lmtrain2 <- lm(pctChange~AVGmarketcap+AVGtotalbitcoins, train2)
test2$p1 <- predict(lmtrain2,test2)
```
```{R}
error=mean(abs(test2$p1-test2$pctChange))
cat("Mean Error = ", error)
```
Very small amount of error.


```{R}
ggplot(test2, aes(test2$Date)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=test2$pctChange),color="Firebrick") +
  geom_line(aes(y=test2$p1), color="Blue")+
  ggtitle('') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10, face="bold", 
    margin = margin(10, 0, 10, 0)))+
  labs(x="Time", y="Percent Change in Value")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'grey75'))+
  labs(title = paste("BTC Market Price % Change ~ BTC Market Cap % Change + Total Coins % Change",
                     "\n\nAdj R2 = ",signif(summary(lmtrain2)$adj.r.squared, 5),
                     " P =",signif(summary(lmtrain2)$coef[2,4], 2)))
```


#Conclusion

Fluctuations in a market are difficult to predict. It is likely that creating a model based on percent change will give a better picture because as prices increase, so does the relative variations in currency value causing heteroscedasticity to play role in a non-zeroed scenario.  Shown above, percent change in the value of Bitcoin is highly dependent to the percent change in market capitalization and percent change in total bitcoins in circulation.  This makes a lot of sense due to the fact it encapsulates supply and demand. Remember that eventually the percent change in the count of bitcoin will become irrelevant due to its finite cap of 21 million coins.
